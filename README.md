## Introduction

Thanks for your interest in joining Polly! For the next step of the interview process, we'd like for you to participate in a small project. Your task is to replicate the results controller in our [mobile app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1270872745?mt=8). It should look something like [this](https://i.imgur.com/DfJfvPo.png).

## Specifications

☑️ Show the `PLYHomeController` in the background behind the poll card.  
☑️ Animate the progress bars sequentially (one after the other) on load.  
☑️ Tapping on the copy button should copy the link (no need to show the banner at the top of the screen).  
☑️ Show the Snapchat button after tapping the copy button (similar to the mobile app experience).   
☑️ Tapping the close button should dismiss the controller.   
☑️ Swipe down card to dismiss.  


## Notes

Try to make the design & UX as similar as possible to the experience in our mobile app (no need to implement the share controller, screenshot detection, delete functionality, or snapchat deep-linking). All assets such as icons and fonts can be found in the Resources folder. The font is *"ProximaNova-Semibold.otf"*.

Please timebox yourself to only **1 hour** on this project.

When you're done, please write a quick post-mortem on how you approached the problem, what tradeoffs you made, things we should look for, etc.
